In the competitive retail landscape, data-driven insights are crucial for success. This project leverages Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, to analyse a departmental store's inventory and sales data. By visualizing key metrics like sales trends, year-over-year performance, and departmental/product performance, the project aims to empower store managers. These insights will guide strategic decision-making in areas like inventory management, product selection, and pricing strategies. Ultimately, this data-driven approach will help optimize store operations and drive improved sales performance.
